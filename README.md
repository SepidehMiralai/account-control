# README
1) Clone the repo and execute `rails s`
2) Sign up as a person or as a legal person
3) After sign up/sign in, click on your name and select manage accounts from the drop down list.
4) You can create new accounts in this page and view your previous accounts.
5) For each account you can choose Action drop down list and view/edit/delete or perform transactions.
6) If you choose transaction in previous step, you will be directed to the transaction lists of that account. You can create a new transaction in this page.
7) If a transaction is of type "deposit" or "contribute" the accounts balance will be updated if it maintains the conditions mentioned in the project description.
8) If a transaction is of type "transfer" and the account balance is more than the transaction's amount, the transfer is done to the current user's first account. (This is an assumption to make implementation easier and to show that the service for account transfer is working.)
